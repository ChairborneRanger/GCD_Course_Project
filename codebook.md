##Code Book

"subject" - This is an integer identifier for the person 
"activity_code" - This is a integer identifier for the activity
"activity" - This is a character string that describes the activity (walking, running, etc.) and is mapped to activity_code

The remaining fields are measurements (see below).  Note that only mean and std measurements are included.  X,Y and Z are the axes involved:
